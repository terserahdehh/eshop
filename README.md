**Reflection 1**

I organized my code into 4 different parts which are controller, service, model, and repository so that each part has its own job. 
The controller handles web requests, the service does the main work, the model is used to represent and define the structure of the data, and the repository manages data. 
I used clear method names like  `findAll` and `delete` which makes the code easy to understand.
Something that I could improve is, adding input validation. I didnâ€™t add checks for valid product data when editing or creating items, so adding input validation would help prevent issues.
